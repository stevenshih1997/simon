- I encountered some difficulty in doing the challenge task. The hardest/longest part was deciding on how to implement the game and associated structures/functions. I approached the problem by basically designing a structure for the game. I had to decide between a function or simply an object, but decided on a function in the end to fit in better with the rest of the code. After choosing the overall design and which functions are needed to implement the game, it was relatively simple to code the task.
